Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation. 
For example, an algorithm with time complexity O(N) is a linear time algorithm .
N is a number of Operation.
 
 Types:
    Constant: 1, 10
    Logarithmic: Log(N) Log(2N) 
 	Linear: N, 2N, 3N
 	Variaty bet linear and quadratic: N*log(N), N*log(N)
 	Quadratic: Nˆ2, 2Nˆ2
 	Cubic: Nˆ3, 2Nˆ3
 	Exponential: 2^N
 
 Big O notation (Notação assintótica): O(1), O(N), O(2N), O(log(2N)), O(Nˆ2), O(2^N)
