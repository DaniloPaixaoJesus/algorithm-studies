 * Binary search works on sorted arrays. 
 * Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value. 
 * If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned. 
 * If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. 
 * If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. 
 * By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration
